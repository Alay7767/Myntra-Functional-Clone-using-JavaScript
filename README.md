# Myntra-Functional-Clone-using-JavaScript

I developed a functional clone of the popular e-commerce platform Myntra using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project replicates key shopping features including:
1) Add to Cart functionality for individual products
2) A dynamic Bag/Cart view that displays all selected items
3) Real-time calculation of total price, discounts, and final payable amount based on items in the bag
4) Interactive and responsive UI to mimic the shopping experience
This project demonstrates my ability to handle DOM manipulation, event handling, and real-time data updates in a shopping cart interface.
